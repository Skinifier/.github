In today's skincare market, individuals often feel overwhelmed by the abundance of products available, making it difficult to find solutions tailored to their specific skin concerns. This challenge is further complicated by the vast array of skincare offerings, hindering effective selection for unique skin issues. Data from the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia reveals that the skincare segment dominates Indonesia's cosmetic market, valued at USD 2.05 billion. The national market size potential in 2023 could exceed 467,919 products, marking more than a 10-fold increase over the past five years. Additionally, there exists a community of individuals who wish to sell or exchange unused skincare products but lack an efficient platform to do so. Amidst these challenges, accessible skincare education tailored to individual needs is also lacking.

# üéØ Our Goals
  To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive skincare application that provides personalized product recommendations and incorporates a marketplace for buying, selling, or exchanging skincare products within a trusted community environment. This application will also feature skin problem detection, expert advice sections, and educational content, aiming to streamline users' skincare journeys while fostering sustainability and knowledge-sharing.

# üìã Our Solutions
  Our team conceived this project in response to the high public interest in trying various skincare products, leading many individuals to purchase and then resell items that are unsuitable, purchased in excess, or simply due to buyer's fatigue. Observations on platforms like Twitter and Shopee show multiple sellers offering the same skincare products, often at lower prices than retail stores, attracting buyers. This inspired us to create a community-focused solution to facilitate the buying and selling of skincare products, making it easier for users to find interested buyers and sellers.
